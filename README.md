Flappy hacker

In this first project, we created a replica of the famous game Flappy Bird using Canvas technology. During development, our focus was on practicing object-oriented programming and also exploring DOM manipulation.

We utilized Canvas technology to create a canvas within the browser where we drew the game elements, such as the bird, pipes, and background. We leveraged object-oriented programming concepts to organize the code into classes and objects, allowing us to have a clear and modular structure.

Furthermore, we took advantage of DOM manipulation to control user interaction with the game. This enabled us to capture events like key presses or mouse clicks and respond accordingly, such as making the bird jump when a key is pressed.
